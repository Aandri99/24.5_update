VGA draw

This is a continuation of the project → :ref:`vga image <vga_image>`


====================
Building the Project
====================

Move to folder RedPitaya/fpga/prj/Examples. 
Uncomment the line "set project_name Vga_draw" and comment all files in the make_project.tcl file. 
Open Vivado and in Vivado Tcl Console navigate to the base folder: *RedPitaya/fpga/prj/Examples*.

Then run the script source make_project.tcl. Tools → Run Tcl Script.


=====================
Step by step tutorial
=====================

After the previous project started working, I wanted to be able to change the picture pattern, picture size and location on the screen. 
I added a few more ports which will be later controlled through AXI_GPIO, with Vitis application.

.. code-block:: vhdl

    entity picture is
        Port (
            clk50: in STD_LOGIC;
            data_position: in unsigned(16 downto 0);
            Offset: in unsigned(15 downto 0);
            size: in unsigned(15 downto 0);
            data_in: in STD_LOGIC;
            hst: out unsigned(10 downto 0);
            vst: out unsigned(9 downto 0);
            rgb: out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(2 downto 0));
    end picture;


* clk50 - 50 MHz clock
* data_position - position to write the data + Write enable bit
* Offset - picture location on the screen
* size - picture size
* data_in - "1" or "0" that are written in array
* hst, vst - current position on the screen
* rgb - signal to be displayed on the screen


I created another block design and connect. It is as seen in the picture.

Block diagram explained
***********************


If you are doing your block design for the first time, 
I reccomend the Zynq book as a good starting point, because it explains basic step how to build a project in vivado.

Ok, let's explain block diagram:

#. First we start with the Zynq7 processing system, these are the brains.
#. I added three AXI_GPIO blocks
    # The first one is connected to on board leds, and it is there just to check if the program is running
    # The second one has two outputs, first one is controlling where and when we write our data to array, on second, the actual data is comming in.
    # The third one also has two outputs, the first one controls the position on the screen, the second one picture size.
#. pictureIP is used to save picture, and to read from the array
#. VGA IP is used to set signals to synchronize the screen and output the data.
#. There is another IP, Clocking Wizard. Linux sets the clock on the FCLK_CLK0 port to 125 MHz, and because we need 50 MHz, we place a Clocking Wizard to lower the clock frequency to the desired rate.


Picture IP and VGA IP located in *RedPitaya\fpga\prj\Examples\Vga_draw*

Setting 50 MHz clock
***********************

First we need to set the source clock from the ZYNQ7 IP.

    :align: center

After setting the 125 MHz clock we have to devide it to 50 MHz that is used in our case. For this we use the Clocking Wizard.

Exporting hardware
***********************

Go to File → Export → Export Hardware

.. figure:: img/VgaDraw5.png
    :alt: Logo
    :align: center

Use a fixed platform type.

.. figure:: img/VgaDraw6.png
    :alt: Logo
    :align: center

Select Include bitstream

.. figure:: img/VgaDraw7.png
    :alt: Logo
    :align: center

Complete the instructions and note the location of the file. In my case, a file named design_1_wrapper

Creating Vitis platform project
*******************************

Start vitis

.. figure:: img/VgaDraw8.png
    :alt: Logo
    :align: center

Press → Create Platform Project
Set the project name and choose **Create from hardware specification (XSA)**
Then point to the generated xsa file (Do not forget to specify the operating system as Linux):

.. figure:: img/VgaDraw9.png
    :alt: Logo
    :align: center

And press finish


The last step is building:

.. figure:: img/VgaDraw10.png
    :alt: Logo
    :align: center

Now we can use the resulting platform to write a program.


Creating Vitis application project
**********************************

Go to File → New → Application project. Click next and select the platform you just created

.. figure:: img/VgaDraw11.png
    :alt: Logo
    :align: center

Press next and set the project name. Leave the rest of the parameters by default.
The next step is choosing a template. I use an empty application.


Copies to the project main.c from the project *RedPitaya/fpga/prj/Examples/Vga_draw/Vitis_sources*

We need the math.h library, so open the Properties of the project and add m

.. figure:: img/VgaDraw12.png
    :alt: Logo
    :align: center

The project should compile.



Vitis code explained
********************

For every AXI_GPIO we have to define its address and its size as is shown below

.. code-block:: c

    static unsigned long addr;
    static unsigned long addr_2;
    static unsigned long addr_3;

    addr = 0x41200000;  
    addr_2 = 0x41220000;	
    addr_3 = 0x41210000;

This is how we define dual port. Second port is shifted by 0x0008.

.. code-block:: c

    data_position = map_base_2 + (addr_2 & MAP_MASK_2);
    data_in = map_base_2 + ((addr_2 + 0x0008) & MAP_MASK_2);



How to run an application on Red Pitaya
****************************************

For running the program on Red Pitaya I used Winscp, to transfer a *.bit* file from vivado and *.elf* file from SDK on the board.

Then open Putty, and run the application.

Go to folder where you saved files on Red Pitaya and type:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    cat <file_name.bit> >/dev/xdevcfg
    chmod +x <file_name.elf>
    ./ <file_name.elf>
