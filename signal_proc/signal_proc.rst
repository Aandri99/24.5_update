This guide covers a range of topics related to the practical applications of using the Red Pitaya for measuring various properties of waveforms. Starting with measuring periodic waveforms, the guide presents lab goals, tasks, inferences, and reference texts. Next, we explore the lab goals and tasks involved in measuring external waveforms, modulation, frequency response of LTI systems, nonlinear systems, and digital filtering using the Red Pitaya.

The guide provides a comprehensive overview of each lab, including the theory, background, and hands-on tasks involved. Whether you are a student, hobbyist, or a professional, this guide offers valuable insights into the practical applications of using the Red Pitaya for measuring various properties of waveforms. By gaining hands-on experience with the Red Pitaya, you can develop your technical skills and expand your knowledge in electrical and computer engineering.
